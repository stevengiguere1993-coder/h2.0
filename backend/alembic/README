Alembic Migrations Directory
============================

This directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic.

Directory Structure:
- versions/: Contains all migration scripts
- env.py: Environment configuration for running migrations
- script.py.mako: Template for generating new migrations

Commands:
---------

# Create a new migration (autogenerate from model changes)
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"

# Apply all pending migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback one migration
alembic downgrade -1

# Rollback to specific revision
alembic downgrade <revision_id>

# View migration history
alembic history

# View current migration
alembic current

# View pending migrations
alembic history --indicate-current

Best Practices:
--------------
1. Always review autogenerated migrations before applying
2. Test migrations on a development database first
3. Keep migrations small and focused
4. Write meaningful migration messages
5. Never edit migrations that have been applied to production
